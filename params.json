At its most basic, a LIMS will allow the user to easily record and access various sample metadata. With the expansion of data caused by the continuing drop in sequencing cost, smaller labs now have the ability to initiate and manage large sequencing projects and begin to take on the complexity of high sample throughput data storage. This has created a need for LIMS that is cost friendly to smaller labs and which contain flexible input fields to accommodate the unique nature of individual labs. Because many labs do not have a dedicated IT position LIMS must also be easy to set-up and maintain with minimal technical proficiency.\r\n\r\nNanoLIMS is a free and open source web based application that is available for deployment and customization via github at no cost. It allows each lab to create custom recording fields specific to the user's lab for each individual sample or a group of samples.  NanoLIMS is currently set up to store DNA/RNA extraction information and sample collection metadata. NanoLIMS was originally created to pair with a sequencing pipeline utilizing Genologics Clarity LIMS Gold and can produce a basic sequencing submission form to be submitted to a Clarity LIMS system. Usernames for each lab individual enables easy data entry and sharing of information across the lab. NanoLIMS also tracks the latest update made to samples by username so that confusion in entries can be easily tracked and resolved. \r\n\r\nNanoLIMS overcomes key challenges common in LIMS by giving labs access to a free and open source tool that also has the flexibility to meet individual lab needs by allowing labs to build custom recording fields. NanoLIMS is also simple to install with minimal technical proficiency. It is our desire that making the web application open source and hosting it on github will encourage the community to build upon NanoLIMS making it more robust and tailored towards the community's growing needs. \r\n\r\n##Authors/Contact Info\r\n\r\nCassie Heinle\r\n\r\ncheinle@ntu.edu.sg\r\n\r\nSingapore Center For Environmental Life Sciences and Engineering\r\n\r\nNanyang Technological University\r\n\r\nwww.scelse.sg\r\n\r\nEmail bugs and feature requests to: cheinle@ntu.edu.sg\r\n\r\n\r\n##License\r\n[Read LICENSE] (https://github.com/cheinle/NanoLIMS/blob/master/license.md)\r\n\r\n",
